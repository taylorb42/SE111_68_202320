        <h2>Bio</h2>
    
        <p>Hi, my name is Taylor, and I'm from new jersey. Some of my favorite hobbies are thrifting, video games, and music. I love being creative and learning new things. I’m really enjoying my time at New England tech and RI as a whole. Everyone I've met has been super nice and very helpful. I’m going for a cybersecurity major and I’m enjoying learning more and more about the technology I use every day. </p>

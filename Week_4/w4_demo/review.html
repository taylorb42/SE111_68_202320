                <p>I think everyone should see <em>Everything Everywhere all at once.</em>to me it has something everyone can enjoy, 
                    it has action, comedy, sci-fi, drama and more. I know that sounds like it's trying to do too much but it balances 
                    all of these genres so well and makes everything flow. With the setting of the multiverse the possibilities are endless 
                    but after watching this movie you two will come to realize that doing laundry and taxes isn't so bad. 10 hotdog fingers out of 10</p>
